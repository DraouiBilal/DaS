# 🖥️ DaS - Desktop as Code

This repository holds my personal **desktop configuration and setup scripts** — treating my entire desktop environment as reproducible code.

## 🔧 What's Included

Current setup includes configuration and installation for:

- 🧠 **Neovim** – my code editor of choice
- 🪟 **Hyprland** – dynamic tiling Wayland compositor
- 🔒 **Hyprlock** – sleek Wayland lock screen
- 📊 **Waybar** – status bar for Wayland
- 💤 **Hypridle** – idle/suspend + lock handler
- 🖼️ **Hyprpaper** – wallpaper manager
- 🔔 **Dunst** – notification daemon

## 🚧 Status

This is a work in progress and will expand as I continue refining and automating my desktop environment.

## 📁 Structure

Each component is organized in its own directory inside this repo with config files, dependencies, and setup notes (or scripts).

## 📦 Goals

- Fully declarative desktop environment
- Easily portable to any machine
- Minimal but powerful Wayland workflow
